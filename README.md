# Hello Everyone, 

I am a product-driven engineer who enjoys solving complex problems that blend **AI, data, and large scale systems**. I have **4.5 years of industry experience** in full-stack development, I’ve always been drawn to exploring different domains, which is why my experience spans enterprise banking systems (JPMorgan Chase), ESG data science, NLP, IoT, ML/RL, and deep learning research. I’m especially curious about how AI can make sustainability practical across finance, agriculture, and healthcare. Being able to apply AI in diverse areas is something that genuinely motivates and satisfies me. This is one of the key reasons I’m interested in this role and eager to see how I can contribute. 

**Education:** M.S. in Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning), State University of New York at Buffalo<br>
**Industry experience:** Cognizant Technology Solutions, supporting the JPMorgan Chase & Co. account<br>
**Recent roles:** Software Engineer (Full-Stack)

## Industry highlights
- Led a 6-member team modernizing a 15-year-old JPMorgan Chase service into **Spring Boot microservices** supporting **30,000+ high-net-worth accounts/month** which previously costed the firm $100,000.
- Built a **JAXB proxy** for XML ↔ Java conversion, saving **$15K**
- Built an **ESG graph + LLM extraction prototype**; with **Louvain clustering**, uncovered risk across **3 supplier tiers** and revealed **$30–35M** in new banking opportunities

## Research 
My research explores **efficient deep learning** (Memory-Augmented LSTMs) and **adaptive automation** (RL-driven hydroponics). I’m motivated by applying AI across domains like **finance, sustainability, agriculture, and healthcare**.

Feel free to explore my repositories, a few of my favorite projects are highlighted below.
- **Auto Encoders & Transformers** — A multi-modal notebook lab spanning **autoencoder reconstruction for anomaly detection**, **Transformers built from scratch in PyTorch**, and applied **LLM workflows** (classification + summarization), plus a **Vision Transformer (ViT)** pipeline for image classification.

- **CNN, RNN & LSTMs** — A hands-on deep learning suite that contrasts **CNN backbones (VGG → ResNet → ResNeXt)** with **sequence models (RNN/LSTM)**, including **vanishing-gradient diagnostics**, **LSTM sentiment analysis**, and **RNN-based time-series forecasting** with practical evaluation metrics.

- **Memory Augmented LSTMs** — “Memory on Demand”: explores **Memory-Augmented LSTMs** with a **differentiable key–value memory (Neural Dictionary)** to reduce catastrophic forgetting and push **few-shot sentiment** toward Transformer-like performance with lighter compute. *(Peer-reviewed paper included in repo.)* 

- **Environmental, Social & Governance(ESG)** — An **ESG Network Analytics** prototype that uses **graph network analysis** (including **Louvain clustering** + **connected components**) to map portfolio relationships and surface **hidden direct/indirect ESG risk** that traditional reports often miss.
