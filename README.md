# Hello Everyone, 

I’m a product-driven engineer working at the intersection of **AI, data, and large-scale systems**. I have **4.5 years of industry experience** in full-stack development and platform modernization, and I’m currently pursuing an **M.S. in Computer Science (AI/ML)**.

- Led a 6-member team modernizing a 15-year-old JPMorgan Chase service into **Spring Boot microservices** supporting **30,000+ high-net-worth accounts/month**
- Built a **JAXB proxy** for XML ↔ Java conversion, saving **$15K**
- Built an **ESG graph + LLM extraction prototype**; with **Louvain clustering**, uncovered risk across **3 supplier tiers** and revealed **$30–35M** in new banking opportunities

My research explores **efficient deep learning** (Memory-Augmented LSTMs) and **adaptive automation** (RL-driven hydroponics). I’m motivated by applying AI across domains like **finance, sustainability, agriculture, and healthcare**.
