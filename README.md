# Hello Everyone, 

I am a product-driven engineer who enjoys solving complex problems that blend **AI, data, and large scale systems**. I have **4.5 years of industry experience** in full-stack development, I’ve always been drawn to exploring different domains, which is why my experience spans enterprise banking systems (JPMorgan Chase), ESG data science, NLP, IoT, ML/RL, and deep learning research. I’m especially curious about how AI can make sustainability practical across finance, agriculture, and healthcare. Being able to apply AI in diverse areas is something that genuinely motivates and satisfies me. This is one of the key reasons I’m interested in this role and eager to see how I can contribute. 

**Education:** M.S. in Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning), State University of New York at Buffalo 
**Industry experience** at Cognizant Technology Solutions, where I worked on the JPMorgan Chase & Co. account.
**Recent roles** include Software Engineer (Full-Stack).

## Industry highlights
- Led a 6-member team modernizing a 15-year-old JPMorgan Chase service into **Spring Boot microservices** supporting **30,000+ high-net-worth accounts/month** which previously costed the firm $100,000.<br>
- Built a **JAXB proxy** for XML ↔ Java conversion, saving **$15K**<br>
- Built an **ESG graph + LLM extraction prototype**; with **Louvain clustering**, uncovered risk across **3 supplier tiers** and revealed **$30–35M** in new banking opportunities

## Research 
My research explores **efficient deep learning** (Memory-Augmented LSTMs) and **adaptive automation** (RL-driven hydroponics). I’m motivated by applying AI across domains like **finance, sustainability, agriculture, and healthcare**.
